# Value Proposition

It's not just about searching through your video content; it's about verifying, annotating, and leveraging it _efficiently_.

This project was born as a hackathon project, and I'm continuing to work and build on top to create an amazing design and user experience, while also providing a way for users to filter through their video database in seconds and annotate it. Check out the devpost!
